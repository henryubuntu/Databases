This is a great opportunity to put in practice your schedule skills and try to guess how many days you will need to learn each part of DB2. 

Take it easy on your schedule, your patience will be enourmosly rewarded (maybe, over panics and crisis, that time will create a natural defense brain mechanism for good control and moderation, we will see ._. )

Finish until you feel you are ready, good luck.
